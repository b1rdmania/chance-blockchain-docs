Resolution Flows

Three paths. One source of truth.

Every market resolves via one of three flows:

Automated

Triggered via price feeds or off-chain data adapters.

Template

Shared resolvers for common events:
sports, politics, macro, elections, news.

Quirky / Optimistic

Anyone can propose an outcome → dispute → escalate if needed.

Regardless of resolver path, the final outcome is written to PredictionHub.

PredictionHub is the single canonical truth surface for Chance.
