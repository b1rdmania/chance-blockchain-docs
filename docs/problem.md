The Problem

Why prediction markets break today.

Prediction markets fail because:

resolution is unclear or centralised

anyone can publish junk markets

every dApp builds its own oracle, dispute system, and settlement logic

The result:

fragmented liquidity

weak trust

repeated reinvention

wasted engineering effort

Chance fixes this at the chain level.
