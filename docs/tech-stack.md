Tech Stack

Chance is built on reliable, simple infrastructure:

OP Stack — rollup backbone

Ethereum — settlement + security

EigenDA / blobs — scalable data availability

ETH — gas token

Pyth / Redstone — price feeds

Keepers — automation for settlement + liquidity

Graph / Goldsky — indexing

Modular resolvers — plug-and-play logic

FeeRouter — revenue distribution

Chance is economically lean and technically conservative by design.
