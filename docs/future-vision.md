# Future Vision

Chance is the first L2 where the base layer understands probability.

As models improve and markets deepen:

- pricing becomes predictive
- governance becomes honest
- risk markets settle transparently
- synthetic indices mature
- AI agents become key participants

Chance becomes the infrastructure for a probabilistic financial system.

Forecast → Trade → Settle.

Simple. Powerful. Inevitable.
