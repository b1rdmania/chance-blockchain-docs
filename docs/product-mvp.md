# Product & MVP

Chance will expand over time, but the core product is clear.

## What Ships First

**1. AI Oracle Engine (Chance Oracle v1)**

One forecasting model.

Returns `getProbability(event)`.

**2. Prediction Market Primitive (Layer-Level)**

Binary markets using an AMM.

Cheap trades. No dApp bottlenecks.

**3. Event Settlement Contract**

All markets settle consistently.

Ethereum-secured finality.

**4. Chance LST (Liquid Staking Token)**

Stakers secure the oracle layer and earn chain-level fees.

**5. Native App: Event Perps**

A perpetual market that trades on probability curves.

This proves the chain’s core thesis.
