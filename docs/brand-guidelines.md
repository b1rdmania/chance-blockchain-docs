# Docs Brand Guidelines

## Voice

- **Short lines**. Declarative sentences. No fluff.
- **Concrete language**. Describe mechanics, not abstractions.
- **Orwell rules**. Prefer clarity over style.

## Structure

- **Page titles** use a single `#` heading with the page name.
- **Sections** use `##` and, if needed, `###` for sub-sections.
- **Lists**:
  - Use `-` bullets.
  - Start items with **bold labels** where it improves scanning.
- **Contracts and modules** are written in inline code, e.g. `PredictionHub.sol`, `MarketStake.sol`.

## Emphasis and Callouts

- Use **bold** sparingly to highlight key concepts or roles.
- Avoid italics unless quoting specific phrases.
- Use blockquotes (`>`) only for short, high-signal callouts.

## Tables

- Use tables only when they make relationships clearer than lists.
- Keep them small and mechanical (2–4 columns, short labels).

## Formatting Rules

- One idea per paragraph.
- No trailing spaces, no decorative characters.
- Leave a blank line between paragraphs, headings, and lists.
