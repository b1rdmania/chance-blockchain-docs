# Why Ethereum

A non-extractive rollup built on shared security.

Chance is an Ethereum L2 because prediction markets only work when the base layer is neutral, durable, and hard to corrupt.

Ethereum gives Chance final settlement, open verification, and economic security proven at scale. A prediction engine cannot sit on a chain that can be censored, reorganised, or captured. Ethereum removes these risks.

The values also align. Prediction needs transparency, permissionless access, and public auditability. Ethereum was built around these principles. Chance inherits them and reinforces them.

Chance is non-extractive. It does not treat users as a revenue stream. Fees flow back to stakers, resolvers, builders, and the treasury. No hidden rent. No private settlement paths. No MEV games against users. The chain’s incentives are clean and visible.

This is a niche chain with a clear purpose. It does not try to host everything. It focuses on resolution, liquidity, and truth. Everything else stays on Ethereum. The relationship is additive, not competitive.

Prediction becomes a public good when the settlement layer behaves like one.

Ethereum is the foundation that makes this possible.
