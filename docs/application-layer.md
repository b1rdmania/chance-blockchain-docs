# Application Layer (Native Suite)

Chance includes a small set of native applications to demonstrate prediction-integrated finance.

## Lending & Borrowing

Interest rates adjust based on forecast volatility.

Liquidations can be probability-triggered.

## ChanceSwap (AMM)

A simple AMM for:

- synthetic event tokens
- index tokens
- stable pairs

Fees rise as uncertainty rises.

## Event Perps

A perpetuals engine tied to event probabilities.

Funding rates reflect predicted volatility rather than historical data.

## Chance LST

The chain’s liquid staking token.

Stakers earn:

- oracle fees
- AMM fees
- settlement fees
- index mint/burn fees
- base gas fees (where applicable)

LST drives the core flywheel.
