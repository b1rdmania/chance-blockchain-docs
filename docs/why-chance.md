# Why Chance Exists

Forecasting infrastructure today is broken:

- polls miss
- credit agencies lag
- public data is political
- markets react late
- governments hide problems
- risk systems are opaque

Meanwhile:

- AI models predict markets, weather, behaviour and macro events with increasing accuracy
- prediction markets outperform experts
- L2s provide low-cost blockspace
- tokenisation is accelerating
- synthetic assets need better underlying signals

Chance is built for this moment.

It is the L2 where:

- predictions are cheap
- settlement is instant
- volatility is priced correctly
- governance has honest signals
- AI and markets reinforce each other

Chance is a chain designed for a world that is becoming probabilistic.
