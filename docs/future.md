# Future Vision

A rollup built for information markets.

Prediction becomes infrastructure.
Resolution becomes public.
Fees are shared.
Builders innovate.
Resolvers earn.
The chain stays simple.

Chance is a rollup built for:

- truth
- clarity
- clean incentives
- shared liquidity
- predictable settlement
- permissionless experimentation

It is a chain where information has a price and outcomes matter.

Prediction is not an app.
It is the base layer.
