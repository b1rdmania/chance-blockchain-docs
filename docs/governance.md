# Governance

Chance governance is driven by stakers.

Governance controls:

- oracle weights
- event definitions
- index specifications
- treasury allocations
- contract parameters
- upgrades

All activity is public.

The predictive layer must always remain transparent.

No private oracle logic.

No hidden changes.

The chain is secured economically through stake and politically through openness.
