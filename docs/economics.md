# Economics

Sustainable protocol revenue.

Chance earns revenue from:

- Resolution fees
- AMM swap fees
- Liquidations (future)
- Slashed builder stakes
- Base-level MEV capture
- DeFi activity
- Grants + partnerships

Low infra cost → high sustainability.
Token optional (and introduced later).

## The economic loop

- Builders stake to create
- Users trade
- Resolvers resolve
- Fees flow to stakers, operators, and treasury
- Treasury funds growth
- More markets → more fees → more stakers

A clean, simple flywheel.
