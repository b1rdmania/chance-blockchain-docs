# Architecture Overview (Chance L2)

Chance is an Ethereum L2 optimised for predictive computation, probabilistic settlement, and event-driven financial logic.

Its architecture has three main layers.

## Oracle Layer

AI models forecast future events and produce:

- probability curves
- confidence intervals
- real-time updates

Models ingest:

- macro data
- financial time series
- climate + weather
- on-chain signals
- behavioural indicators

Chance verifies model outputs on-chain through attestation, batching, or cryptographic proofs (depending on implementation phase).

## Market Layer

Prediction markets live at the chain level.

Types include:

- binary
- continuous
- conditional
- synthetic indices

Markets run on:

- AMMs
- hybrid orderbooks
- probability-aware pricing curves

Errors cost money.

Truth compounds.

## Settlement Layer

Smart contracts settle outcomes when:

- an event resolves, or
- a probability threshold is crossed, or
- a synthetic index updates

Products include:

- governance risk indices
- climate indices
- sovereign risk curves
- macro-event perps
- project completion indices

Chance allows builders to treat events the way DeFi treats prices.

## Reflexivity

Predictions affect decisions.

Decisions affect predictions.

Chance does not hide reflexivity.

It harnesses it to create stable, transparent feedback loops.
