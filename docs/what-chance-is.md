What Chance Is

A canonical engine for resolving markets.

Chance is an OP-based rollup with one core primitive:
a chain-level system for resolving prediction markets.

Builders stake collateral to create markets.
Resolvers stake to publish outcomes.
Stakers earn protocol fees.
The chain captures revenue from all prediction activity.

Chance ships with built-in DeFi tools designed around prediction flow.

Everything is on-chain.
Everything is verifiable.
