# Overview

Chance is an Ethereum Layer 2 purpose-built for prediction, probabilistic finance, and AI-oracle settlement.

It offers:

- **AI-powered oracles** that forecast future events
- **Prediction markets** embedded at the chain level
- **Event-driven settlement** secured by Ethereum
- **A native DeFi suite** built to use probability as a primitive

Chance exists because forecasting, risk, and governance need a transparent, fast, and low-cost execution environment.

Ethereum provides security. Chance provides purpose.

The result:

Data → Probability → Markets → Settlement → Fees → Stakers

Chance is the first L2 where the base layer understands time, uncertainty, and events.
