Chance Blockchain

The prediction-native OP Superchain rollup.

Markets run cleanly when truth sits at the base layer.

Chance is an Ethereum L2 with:

a built-in resolution engine

a stake-to-create model

resolver modules

a canonical DeFi stack

Prediction is not an application.
It is part of the chain.

Chance turns resolution into public infrastructure.
