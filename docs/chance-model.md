# The Chance Model

Resolution at the base layer.

Chance is built around a single primitive:

`PredictionHub.sol` — the canonical registry for all prediction markets on the chain.

Everything on Chance flows through five components:

- **PredictionHub** — the source of truth
- **Stake-to-Create** — builders post collateral
- **Protocol Fees** — chain-wide revenue model
- **Resolvers & Automation** — modular settlement
- **Canonical DeFi Stack** — tools built for prediction flow

Each is described below.
